# An example default `cbf` script. This would automatically run from any repo by just running `cbf` from the cli.
#
# This also shows that you can nest `cbf` scripts
example:
  alias: "cbf -r alias.simple.yml"
  deploy: "cbf -r deploy.simple.yml"
  directories: "cbf -r directories.simple.yml"
  input: "cbf -r input.simple.yml"
  project: "cbf -r project.simple.yml"
  setup: "cbf -r setup.simple.yml"
